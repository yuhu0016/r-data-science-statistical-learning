# R for Data Science & Statistical Learning

One of the broad goals of data science is examining raw data with the purpose of identifying its structure and trends, and of deriving conclusions and hypotheses from it. In the modern world awash with data, data analytics is more important than ever to fields ranging from biomedical research, space and weather science, finance, business operations and production, to marketing and social media applications.

This repository contains examples of various statistical learning methods and their applications, including some of the following:
